# Heart Disease Prediction Using Neural Networks in PyTorch

Predicting heart disease from clinical data is a critical task in healthcare analytics. This project demonstrates how to build, train, and evaluate a neural network for heart disease prediction using PyTorch and scikit-learn.

## 🚀 Project Overview

- **Goal:** Predict the presence of heart disease based on patient clinical features.
- **Tech Stack:** Python, PyTorch, scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn
- **Dataset:** Processed Switzerland Heart Disease dataset

## 📊 Features

- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Feature scaling and train-test split
- Neural network model built with PyTorch
- Training and evaluation with loss and accuracy metrics
- Visualization of training/testing loss curves
- Confusion matrix visualization for both train and test sets
- Recommendations for further improvement

## 📝 Usage

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<repo-name>.git
    cd <repo-name>
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *(Or manually install: pandas, numpy, torch, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn)*

3. **Run the notebook:**
    - Open [Heart-diease-prediction.ipynb](http://_vscodecontentref_/0) in Jupyter Notebook or VS Code.
    - Run all cells to see data processing, model training, and evaluation.

## 📈 Results

- The model achieves reasonable accuracy on both training and test sets.
- Confusion matrices provide insight into prediction performance and class distribution.
- Loss curves help visualize the learning process and detect overfitting.

## 💡 Recommendations for Improvement

- Address class imbalance using resampling or class weights.
- Experiment with different neural network architectures and hyperparameters.
- Use cross-validation for more robust performance estimation.
- Try regularization techniques to improve generalization.
